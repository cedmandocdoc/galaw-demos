# Galaw demos

Compilation demos of Galaw animation library. [Galaw](https://github.com/cedmandocdoc/galaw) is a set of tools for building composable, scalable, and reusable animation in JavaScript. It is built on top of [Agos](https://github.com/cedmandocdoc/agos), a reactive functional library. Currently, Galaw is not ready yet but this demos helps to clear some goals on Galaw's roadmap.
